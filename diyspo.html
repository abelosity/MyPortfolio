          <p>We set out to design a virtual reality (VR) headset, specifically developed for use in the medical environment. Using cardboard and plastic as the core materials behind our design, we aimed to create a headset tailored to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy sessions at a hospital or medical facility.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="project-display phase-content">
          <p>Chemotherapy can be a long, toilsome process. Given how sessions generally can last from 3 to 4 hours, the very stressful nature of the treatment coupled along with such long spans of time can become frustrating for patients. Depending on the facility, patients may be undergoing therapy in individual rooms or sections, or in a general shared space with other patients also undergoing chemotherapy. We felt that such a stressful process can become overbearing on an individual, and sometimes a good distraction could help. This is where we believe VR could come into play.</p>
          <p>We set out to develop a VR headset tailored for individuals in such situations, specifically designed with their environment and health factors in mind. Patients can simply insert their own personal smartphone into the headset and explore a variety of VR content, learning, watching and exploring a whole new realm of content and information.</p>

          <p>Our design process began with thorough research into the routines and experiences of our audience. We had to develop a solution that would be easily set up, customized to accommodate a variety of devices, and easy to sanitize. Given the range of effects that chemotherapy can have on patients at different stages of their treatment, the design had to be flexible to be comfortable for a variety of individuals and circumstances.</p>

          <h3>Our proposal</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="project-display phase-content">
          <p>Diyspo is a lightweight, modular VR headset that is comprised of a solid acrylic shell and a foldable cardboard insert.</p>
          <p>The headsetâ€™s shell is strong and simple, with face padding and a head strap for comfortable usage. The cardboard insert is laser cut with directions and perforations which can easily be folded to form the exterior shell of the headset. The insert houses the lens and the smartphone device, and locks onto the headset to secure the headset.</p>
          <p>Diyspo aims to make "disposable" VR headsets more comfortable while lowering the negative environmental impacts due to large amounts of waste being produced. Users will receive upon arriving at the facility a pre-cut Diyspo cardboard insert. It is designed to be constructable by users of all skill levels, and comes with a variety of predefined device trims already perforated into the insert for easy selection. Simply receive the acrylic shell from the facility, choose the appropriate device size, and fold up the headset for VR exploring! The cardboard shell exterior allows users to customize the headset, and the insert will last multiple uses so they can bring it back for their next visit. Should they want to discard the insert, the facility can easily separate the shell and lenses from the insert. The simple, hollow design of the shell makes sanitization quick and plausible in large quantities. The cardboard material can be disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner.  Inserts can be produced out of recycled cardboard, further reducing the environmental footprint of Diyspo. Being used in large quantities at such facilities, inserts can be cut in orders for less than a dollar a piece.
